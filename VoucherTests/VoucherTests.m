// Things to test:
// Server:
// - Can publish given good name and unique id
// - cannot publish with invalid name and unique id
// - Can start or resume serving if/after airplane mode
// Client:
// - Can start browsing with good name + id
// - Cannot start browing bad name and/or id
// - Can start or resume browsing if/after airplane mode
// -
// Integration tests of both:
// - Client connects to server, then disconnects after opening streams
//      => Server should resume serving, ready to receive connections
//      => Client should be able to connect to next server
// - Client connects to server, client sends data, then disconnects while server is waiting for user response
// - Client connects to server, server stops publishing, then resumes publishing
// - Client up first;, then server comes online
// - Server up first, then client comes online
